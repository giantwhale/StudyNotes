The MNIST dataset was constructed from scanned document database from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). (MNIST is short for Modified NIST).

Each image is 28x28 square (784 pixels total). The training set contains 60,000 images, and the testing set contains 10,000 images. There are 10 digits (0 to 9) to predict. 

The state-of-the-art prediction error is approximately 0.2%, throught large CNN. Here is the link to a list of models and the corresponding prediction errors: http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#4d4e495354
